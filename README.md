# RPG-Tile-Game
A simple RPG implemented as a tile based game.

NOTE:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I knew very little about creating a tile based game before I watched KidsCanCode's series of videos:

Tile-based game part X.

There are are 23 parts to the series!

I've modifed some of the code, in part because I want to develop an old-school RPG.

Here is KidsCanCode's (Chris Bradfield's) youtube page:
